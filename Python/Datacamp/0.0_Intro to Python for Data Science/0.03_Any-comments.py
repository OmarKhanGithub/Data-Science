# Any comments?
#Something that Filip didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

# To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, # Division; it is completely ignored during execution.

# INSTRUCTIONS

Above the print(7 + 10), add the comment # Addition.

# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition works too
print(7 + 10)
